## Goal
***

The aim of this analysis is to do an EDA, cleanup and visualization of a dataset about Amazon Best Sellers Books between 2009 and 2019. 

The data can be downloaded from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sootersaalu/amazon-top-50-bestselling-books-2009-2019).

## Conclusions
***

In the course of the analysis, it was established which authors have been the most successful, how many books are there by each author, which books receive the best reviews from readers. In addition, it was found that non-fiction literature is becoming more often a bestseller, but users also like fiction more.
